Grid Plugin Installation
========================
Grid provides an effective, simple and lightweight chat solution for BungeeCord networks. This document is aimed at new
users who have no experience with installing hybrid (universal) plugins. Feel free to skip this guide if you are capable
of utilizing your common sense!

1.0 Distributions
-----------------
Grid is distributed in two flavors that are designed for users of different experience levels:
* Universal (entry level)
* Advanced (advanced users)

The universal distribution may be installed on both BungeeCord and Bukkit. The advanced distribution was designed to be
used by users who prefer lightweight installations and comes with separate jars for BungeeCord and Bukkit.

2.0 BungeeCord
--------------
1. Choose a jar (either universal or advanced)
2. Drop into BungeeCord's plugin directory (this directory is usually located next to your BungeeCord jar)
3. (Re-)Start BungeeCord

The plugin will now create it's default configurations automatically. You may change the settings by navigating to the
plugin directory (plugins/Grid) and editing the config.cndl. An in-depth documentation can be found at
https://github.com/PlaySpud/Grid/wiki/Configuration

3.0 CraftBukkit/Spigot
----------------------
1. Choose a jar (either universal or advanced)
2. Drop into CraftBukkit/Spigot's plugin directory (this directory is usually located next to your CraftBukkit/Spigot jar)
3. (Re-)Start CraftBukkit/Spigot

Note: The Bukkit plugin does not provide any functionality for end users. You will only need to install it if you have
one or more plugins that interact with Grid.
